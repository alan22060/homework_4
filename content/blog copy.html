						<h4>Exploring</h4>

						<p>I have always enjoyed visiting old places and discovering new places.</p>

						<p>Exploring is not only a stress relieve for me, but also a where I find peace. From beaches to hiking, and enjoying a nice place to eat. All this is needed in life, since we all need to find the balance between work and self peace </p>
